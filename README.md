# Arabic-Voice-Chatbot-with-Vosk-Cohere-and-gTTS
This project is a terminal-based Arabic voice chatbot that listens to your spoken input, converts it to text using Vosk speech recognition, sends the text to the Cohere language model for an Arabic reply, and then reads the reply aloud using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) with playback via pygame.
