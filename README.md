# Arabic-Voice-Chatbot-with-Vosk-Cohere-and-gTTS
This project is a terminal-based Arabic voice chatbot that listens to your spoken input, converts it to text using Vosk speech recognition, sends the text to the Cohere language model for an Arabic reply, and then reads the reply aloud using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) with playback via pygame.

# Features
- Real-time Arabic speech-to-text transcription using Vosk.

- Contextual Arabic text replies generated by Cohere's command-r-plus chat model.

- Arabic text reshaping and bidirectional display correction for proper console output.

- Text-to-speech synthesis in Arabic using gTTS.

- Audio playback of the chatbot’s reply using pygame.

- Easy to run in any terminal with microphone support.

# Requirements
- Python 3.7 or newer.

- Microphone connected and properly configured.

- Internet connection (for Cohere API and gTTS).

# Python Libraries Used

- sounddevice — for capturing audio from the microphone.

- vosk — offline speech recognition toolkit.

- queue — thread-safe audio data handling.

- json — parsing Vosk's recognition results.

- arabic_reshaper — fixes Arabic text shaping for proper display.

- python-bidi — bidirectional algorithm for correct Arabic text display in terminals.

- cohere — API client to interact with Cohere's language models.

- gtts — Google Text-to-Speech for synthesizing Arabic speech.

- pygame — for playing back the synthesized speech audio.

- os — to handle temporary audio file cleanup.
